                The latest release is version 2.4.3. All users are encouraged to upgrade to at least 2.4.2 as some major
                performance and security issues were solved in this release.  Most of them only affect folks using
                the VelocityDisplayer. The major change for VelocityDisplayer users is that globalMacros.vm
                has now moved into the JAR itself. You no longer need to put it in your WEB-INF/classes directory.
                For permissions checking in a velocity template, you'll now need to use $displayer.isAllowed($menu) as
                explained in <a href="http://issues.appfuse.org/browse/SM-58#action_10997">
                JIRA issue SM-58</a>.
